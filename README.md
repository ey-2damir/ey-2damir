I am a second-year student at Beni Suef University of Korean Technology, majoring in Computer Science. I 
have a basic understanding of various programming languages including C, C++, Java, PHP, Python, as 
well as web development technologies like HTML and CSS. Additionally, I have a foundational 
understanding of computer networks thanks to my study of CCNA. I am looking for opportunities to 
further develop my skills and gain practical experience in the field of technology.
